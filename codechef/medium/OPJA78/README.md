class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int amount = scanner.nextInt();
        BankAccount account1 = new BankAccount(amount);

        amount = scanner.nextInt();
        BankAccount account2 = new BankAccount(amount);

        System.out.println(account1.totalBalance);
