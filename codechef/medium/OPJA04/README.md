## Problem

### Access Modifiers in Java

In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, fields, and other members within a class. There are four main access modifiers in Java:

- public: Accessible from anywhere.
- private: Accessible only within the same class.
- protected: Accessible within the same class, subclasses(not necessarily in the same package), and other classes in the same package.
- Default (package-private): Accessible within the same package.
### Task

Which of the following is a valid reason for error in the given code ?

```
class Student {
    private int age;
}

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.age = 10;
    }
}

```
